      <p><strong> <em>There are 4 main pillars of Object Oriented programming:</em> </strong>
        <ol>
          <li> Encapsulation</li>
          <p><em>ENCAPSULATION:</em> This is a way of hiding data that you don't want the user or any other programmer modifying. For instance, a particular variable can be encapsulated which would not allow the user or any other programmer working on the same program
          to change or alter the nature/value/name of the variable. In order to accomplish Encapsulation, access modifiers are used. Example of access modifiers are private, protected, and public. When a variable is set as private, one cannot access that variable unless it is in the same class.
        If one has to access that particular variable in a separate class, a getter and setter method has to be made in the class in which the variable is declared. Then, the getter and setter methods are called in the class where the variable is to be used.
      A getter method "gets" the value stored in the variable. A setter method stores/"sets" a value in the variable.   </p>

<h2>Features used in making the Hospital Management System:</h2>
</div>
<div class="FeaturesHMS_detail">
  <ol>
    <li> Inheritance</li>
  <p>Inheritance is when a class derives attributes and methods from another class. The class it derives from is called the parent class, and the class which derives the information is called the child class. <br>
  Inheritance is defined using the extend keyword. Inheritance explains a is-a relationship between the classes.
  </p>
  <li>Composition</li>
  <p>Composition explains a has-a relationship between classes. It uses instance variables of other classes. In other words, when declaring a variable, the “type” can include int, String, double, etc. In the case of composition, the type can include the names of other classes. The variable then attains all the features of the class which is its “type”. </p>
  <li>Aggregation</li>
  <p>This is when two or more objects are related but can function without the existence of one another and without either one of them being the owner. For instance, a doctor can have multiple patients, likewise, a patient can visit multiple doctors. </p>
