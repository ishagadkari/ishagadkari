      <p><strong> <em>There are 4 main pillars of Object Oriented programming:</em> </strong>
        <ol>
          <li> Encapsulation</li>
          <p><em>ENCAPSULATION:</em> This is a way of hiding data that you don't want the user or any other programmer modifying. For instance, a particular variable can be encapsulated which would not allow the user or any other programmer working on the same program
          to change or alter the nature/value/name of the variable. In order to accomplish Encapsulation, access modifiers are used. Example of access modifiers are private, protected, and public. When a variable is set as private, one cannot access that variable unless it is in the same class.
        If one has to access that particular variable in a separate class, a getter and setter method has to be made in the class in which the variable is declared. Then, the getter and setter methods are called in the class where the variable is to be used.
      A getter method "gets" the value stored in the variable. A setter method stores/"sets" a value in the variable.   </p>
          <li> Abstraction</li>
          <li> Inheritance</li>
          <li> Polymorphism</li>
        </ol>

      <div class="Question1">
        <strong>Question: <br> <br> </strong> Getting a single-occupancy room in a dormitory is very tough because of the high demand. There is one especially large and comfortable single occupancy room in your dorm that everybody covets. The housing office runs a lottery at the beginning of a quarter. Students must submit their entries before the lottery. The result of the lottery will consist of three cards. The numbers on the cards range from 10 to 15 and the color of the card can be red, green, or black. Write a program to create winning combination of lottery card. Use two classes LotteryCard and RoomWinner. RoomWinner will be the driver class.
        <br> <br> <em> Note: This Question uses <strong>ENCAPSULATION.</strong></em>

          <p>Color and Number are two variables that are encapuslated as their access modifiers are private. In order to get access to the values stored in the variables, a getter method has been created.
          Some other access modifiers: <br><strong> Protected:</strong> Any variable declared as protected can only be accessed within that particular package, however, if it has to be accessed in a separate package, it has to be through inheritance.
         <br> <strong>Public:</strong> It can be accessed anyhow, within the class and outside the class, furthermore, also within and outside the package. <br><em>Note: Methods can also have access modifiers.</em>  </p>
