<div class="CrossModalPlasticity">
  <p>Cross modal plasticity is the phenomenon in which cortical reorganization is induced due to loss of sensory modality. This leads to enhanced sensory functioning of the remaining modalities.
When an individual experiences a type of sensory deprivation, the cortical region associated with that sensory modality is hijacked by the cortices of other sensory modalities, thereby improving the sensitivity as well as creativity of the remaining sensory modalities. This can be seen in both humans and animals.  <br><br>
Studies in animals have provided evidence in support of cross-modal plasticity. Kittens whose eyelids were sutured at birth displayed their visual cortex as encroached by the neighboring auditory and somatosensory areas due to loss of visual stimuli during critical period. This cross-modal plasticity enhanced their localization discrimination tasks that relied on the other senses.  <br>
A study conducted in humans (Sensitive period for cognitive repurposing of human visual cortex) affirmed the same. The study included 19 blindfolded sighted, 13 adult-onset blind, and 20 congenitally blind individuals and all participants were older than the age 18. All blind individuals had lost sight due to pathology at or anterior to the optic chiasm and not due to brain damage. The participants were assigned behavior tasks which included performing auditory math and language control tasks while undergoing fMRI, in other words, the tasks were recited rather than displayed. The group to perform the worst was the adult-onset blind individuals as compared to the congenitally blind and sighted individuals. Even though, at any age, blindness caused cortices to synchronize with specific and appropriate fronto-parietal networks, task-based specializations were only visible in congenitally blind individuals. It was found that dorsal occipital area and V1 are responsive towards math equations and increase in activity with difficulty of the equations. On the other hand, it was the lateral occipital area and the occipitotemporal cortex which were more responsive to sentences. This detailed specialization was only found in congenitally blind individuals.
Adult-onset blindness did show activation of the occipital cortex during tasks but did not show as much specialization as congenitally blind.
<br> <br>  Furthermore, it was found that connectivity of the visual cortex with other brain regions remains modifiable into adulthood. However, the correlations between the visual cortex and higher cognitive networks are higher in congenitally blind vs adult-onset blind individuals. <br><br>
“Visual” cortex responds to spoken language in blind children: <br><br>
In this experiment, 19 blind individuals, 20 blindfolded individuals, and 20 sighted individuals were chosen for the study. The blind individuals had lost sight due to pathology anterior to the optic chiasm. The individuals were made to hear an English story, a foreign language story and some instrumental music. After the 20 second clip followed a prompt: “Does this come next?” successively followed by a 3 second clip with a continuation of the same story, the same foreign or alternate language, or continuation of the same melody with instrument or a different instrument.  <br><br>
It was found that in the absence of visual input, occipital regions responded to spoken language by early childhood. Despite being blind for decades, individuals who became blind in adulthood failed to show responses to spoken language in occipital cortex. <br><br>
Both the aforementioned studies briefly speak about the hierarchy of critical periods. The latter (visual cortex responds to spoken language in blind children) finds that this cross-modal plasticity, likewise, the occipital specialization for different input, occurred as early as 4 years of age, as it was found that at 4, the occipital cortex responded more to stories than to foreign speech or music.
<br> A more detailed understanding of the occipital specialization based on tasks was seen in the former paper (Sensitive period for cognitive repurposing of the human visual cortex) where in it was found that the order of task-based occipital specialization followed the order: <br><br>
Congenitally blind > adult-onset blind > blind-folded sighted individuals.
